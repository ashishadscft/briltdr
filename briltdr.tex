% This is over-written in the CMS environment: useful as preprint no. for export versions
% >> Title: please make sure that the non-TeX equivalent is in PDFTitle below for papers. For PASs, PDFTitle can be used with plain TeX.

% >> Authors
%Author is always "The CMS Collaboration" for PAS and papers, so author, etc, below will be ignored in those cases
%For multiple affiliations, create an address entry for the combination
%To mark authors as primary, use the \author* form

% The date is in yyyy/mm/dd format. Today has been
% redefined to match, but if the date needs to be fixed, please write it in this fashion.

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. For PASs: **DO NOT use CMS tex macros.**...in the abstract: CDS MathJax processor used on the abstract doesn't understand them _and_ will only look within $$. The abstracts for papers are hand formatted so macros are okay.
\abstract{
   Your abstract here.
}

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text with the possible exception of the PDFtitle for a PAS. Then you can use pure TeX symbols as if on a typewriter. Examples: $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$ => $sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV; 32\fbinv => 32 fb$^{-1}$
% No unescaped comment % characters.
% No curly braces {} except for TeX in the PDFtitle.

%% **DO NOT REMOVE THE BIBLIOGRAPHY** which is located before the appendix.
%% You can take the text between here and the bibiliography as an example which you should replace with the actual text of your document.
%% If you include other TeX files, be sure to use "\input{filename}" rather than "\input filename".
%% The latter works for you, but our parser looks for the braces and will break when uploading the document.

% >> acknowledgments (for journal papers only)
% The latest version of the acknowledgments will be included from https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/Internal/PubAcknow as of the date of submission. Modify to match either US or UK English spelling for centre/center, programme/program. For PRL use the short version, for JINST normally use the long version. All others take the middle length version other than exceptional cases.
